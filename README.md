# 🏨 Hotel Booking Analysis – End-to-End EDA using Python

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of hotel booking data to understand **booking cancellation patterns, pricing behavior (ADR), hotel type performance, and customer trends**.  
The analysis is performed using Python with real-world data to extract meaningful business insights.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Analyze **canceled vs non-canceled bookings**
- Compare **City Hotel vs Resort Hotel** performance
- Study **Average Daily Rate (ADR)** trends over time
- Identify **top countries contributing to cancellations**
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing for accurate analysis

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** – Data visualization
- **Seaborn** – Advanced visualizations
- **Jupyter Notebook**

---

## 📂 Dataset
- Hotel booking dataset containing information on:
  - Booking status
  - Hotel type
  - Arrival dates
  - Average Daily Rate (ADR)
  - Country of origin
  - Reservation status dates

---

## 🔍 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Converted date columns from object to datetime
- Handled missing and inconsistent values
- Filtered required date ranges (2016 – Sep 2017)
- Separated canceled and non-canceled bookings
- Aggregated data for time-series analysis

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 1️⃣ Cancellation Analysis
- Compared canceled vs non-canceled bookings
- Calculated cancellation percentage
- Visualized reservation status distribution

### 2️⃣ Hotel Type Comparison
- Analyzed cancellation behavior across:
  - City Hotel
  - Resort Hotel
- Identified higher cancellation trends in city hotels

### 3️⃣ ADR (Average Daily Rate) Analysis
- Compared ADR for canceled vs non-canceled bookings
- Studied ADR trends over time
- Analyzed monthly ADR patterns

### 4️⃣ Country-wise Analysis
- Identified top 10 countries with the highest cancellations
- Visualized geographical contribution to cancellations

---

## 📈 Key Visualizations
- Reservation Status Count (Canceled vs Not Canceled)
- Hotel Type vs Cancellation Count
- ADR Trend Over Time
- Monthly ADR Bar Chart
- Top 10 Countries with Reservation Cancellations

*(All visualization screenshots are available in the `images/` folder)*

---

## 💡 Key Insights
- **City hotels experience higher cancellations** compared to resort hotels
- **Canceled bookings often show different ADR behavior** than confirmed bookings
- Certain **countries contribute significantly to cancellations**
- Seasonal trends impact **pricing and booking behavior**
- ADR varies noticeably across months and booking status

---

## 📌 Conclusion
This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Perform **end-to-end data analysis**
- Clean and preprocess real-world datasets
- Apply **EDA techniques** to extract insights
- Build meaningful **data visualizations**
- Translate data into **business-relevant findings**

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add predictive modeling for cancellation probability
- Perform customer segmentation
- Build an interactive dashboard using Power BI or Tableau
